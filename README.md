### User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project

Project purpose: Presentation of static data
In this project, you’ll build a static front-end site to present useful information to users, using all the technologies that you have learned about so far.

Value provided:
1. Data is presented in a way that helps users achieve their goals, e.g. learning about a product/service that they are interested in.
2. The presentation of this data advances the site owner's goals, e.g. helps them market a product/service.

### Project Requirements

#### Main Technologies

Required: HTML, CSS

Optional: Bootstrap and/or other CSS libraries/frameworks.

#### Mandatory Requirements
A project violating any of these requirements will FAIL

* Static front end project: Write custom HTML5 and CSS3 code to create a website of at least 3 pages, or (if using a single scrolling page), at least 3 separate page areas.
* Information Architecture: Incorporate a main navigation menu and structured layout (you might want to use Bootstrap to accomplish this).
* Documentation: Write a README.md file for your project that explains what the project does and the value that it provides to its users.
* Version Control: Use Git & GitHub for version control.
* Attribution: Maintain clear separation between code written by you and code from external sources (e.g. libraries or tutorials). Attribute any code from external sources to its source via comments above the code and (for larger dependencies) in the README.
* Deployment: Deploy the final version of your code to a hosting platform such as GitHub Pages.

### Changelog

Added Bootstrap 5.3.3 link to head above/before the link to style.css thus allowing style.css to override styles inherrited in the bootstrap . Added bootstrap nav bar to header in html. This is to make navigation easier and the coding of navigation easier. This is also demonstrating that I have employed bootstrap code to assist development to fulfill criteria of the Milestone project assessment.

Added styling to re-position logo and its accompanying text within navbar
